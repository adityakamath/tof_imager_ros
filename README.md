# vl53l5cx_ros


Note: This implementation is a bit over-engineered, as I have been experimenting with ROS 2 [managed/lifecycle](https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) nodes, [executors](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Executors.html#executors) and [composition](https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/rolling/rclpy/executors/examples_rclpy_executors/composed.py) using Python.
